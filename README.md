## 🌍 Why TruthBounty?

Misinformation erodes trust, fuels conflict, and weakens democratic and social systems.  
TruthBounty exists to turn **fact-checking into a decentralized public good**, powered by cryptoeconomic incentives rather than centralized authority.

This API provides the core infrastructure for:

- Community-driven news verification  
- Reputation-based trust scoring  
- Transparent, verifiable evidence storage  
- On-chain rewards for honest participation  

By aligning incentives with truth, TruthBounty enables communities to collectively defend information integrity.

## 🌱 Ecosystem Alignment (Ethereum, Stellar & Public Goods)

TruthBounty is intentionally built within the **Ethereum ecosystem** and aligned with open-source public-good values:

- **Ethereum** – neutral, permissionless base layer  
- **Optimism** – scalable, low-cost reward distribution  
- **IPFS** – decentralized evidence storage  
- **Worldcoin ID** – Sybil resistance for fair participation  
- **Drips Network** – sustainable funding for maintainers and contributors  

This API is designed to be **forkable, composable, and reusable** by:

- News platforms  
- Civic-tech organizations  
- Browser extensions  
- DAO governance systems  
- Research and media tooling

## 🌟 Stellar Ecosystem Alignment (Planned & Compatible)

TruthBounty is designed as a **chain-agnostic verification protocol**, with first-class compatibility for ecosystems that prioritize **low-cost transactions, public goods, and global accessibility** — making **Stellar a natural extension target**.

### Why Stellar?

- **Ultra-low fees** enable high-frequency verification without economic friction  
- **Global accessibility** aligns with TruthBounty’s mission to fight misinformation worldwide  
- **Soroban smart contracts** are well-suited for:
  - Reward distribution
  - Reputation state updates
  - Verifier staking logic  
- **Stellar’s public-good focus** mirrors TruthBounty’s commitment to open infrastructure

### Planned Stellar Integrations

- Optional reward settlement on Stellar for micro-incentives  
- Cross-chain verification proofs (Ethereum ↔ Stellar)  
- Soroban-based reputation and reward modules  
- Support for Stellar-native wallets for verifier onboarding  

TruthBounty treats **blockchains as infrastructure, not lock-in**, enabling communities to verify truth wherever participation is most accessible.

## 🧩 High-Level Architecture

1. News reports are submitted via the API  
2. Verifiers authenticate using Worldcoin ID  
3. Users stake tokens to participate in verification  
4. Evidence (links, screenshots, metadata) is stored on IPFS  
5. Reputation scores are recalculated in real time  
6. Smart contracts distribute rewards on Optimism  
7. Verification results are exposed via public API endpoints  

> The API is intentionally modular to support multiple frontends and clients.
